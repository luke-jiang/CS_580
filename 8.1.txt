Q8.1:
A looped tree is a weighted, directed graph built from a binary tree by adding
an edge from every leaf back to the root. Every edge has non-negative weight.

A:
(a)
  Dijkstra's algorithm takes O(m + nlogn) time to run.
(b)
  1. run DFS from the root to find all back edges (edges pointing back to the root).
  2. remove the back edges from the looped tree to get T'.
  3. run DFS from u in T' to see if there exists a path (u, v) in T'.
     if found, then the path (u, v) is the shortest path.
  4. else, shortest path = shortest_path(u, s) + path(s, v).
  5. run BFS w/ weight to find shortest path from (u, s).

  overall runtime: O(m + n)
