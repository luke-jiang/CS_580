(a)
run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path E, but with the following
modification:
  instead of keeping one pred label, keep two pred labels (pred1 and pred2),
  where pred2 points to the predecessor of second shortest path from s.
  consider all vertices in the reverse oder in path E.
    if the vertex doesn't have pred2, then the result is INF.
    else, suppose the pred2 label is v'. all vertices in path(v', v)
    has result v'.dist + W(v', v)
